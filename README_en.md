# MauiTune

**MauiTune** is a demo application created to explore and test the integration of **.NET MAUI** with **OAuth 2.0** and the **Spotify API**. The primary goal of this project is to provide an educational platform for learning and experimenting with these technologies, and it is not intended for commercial use.

## Description

**MauiTune** offers a practical experience for developers interested in:

- **Cross-Platform Development with .NET MAUI**: Utilizes **.NET MAUI** to build native applications for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single codebase.

- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Implements the **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow to connect and authorize access to the **Spotify API**, including obtaining access tokens.

- **Interaction with the Spotify API**: Allows access to musical data from the **Spotify API**, such as user profiles, playlists, and most-listened tracks.

## Key Objectives

- **Explore .NET MAUI**: Learn and experiment with cross-platform development using **.NET MAUI**.
  
- **Implement OAuth 2.0**: Demonstrate how to implement authentication and authorization with **OAuth 2.0** for interacting with services like **Spotify**.

- **Interact with the Spotify API**: Test and understand how to work with the **Spotify API** to manage musical data.
